            "This Sofa chair can be stained or painted in a colour of your choice and upholstered in a fabric to suit your personal taste. The Sinuoso Bespoke Upholstered Modern Wingback Barrel Chair is oh so sinuous! A modern day chair that combines two popular chair styles, the wing chair and the barrel chair. This armchair illustrates the Millmax signature style of show-wood surrounding the upholstery. The 'wings' of the chair stretch down to the armrests and continue in one fluid movement to the legs, whilst the semi-circular 'barrel' back continues the sinuous sexy lines of this designer armchair.",

Walnut-finished birch legs splay an angled swivel base that complements the matte look of the soft, almost suede-like leather upholstery. To keep things looking neat and tidy, the comfy pillow seat cushion clips to the back of the chair.",
